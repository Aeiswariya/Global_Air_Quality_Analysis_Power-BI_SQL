# 🌍 AQI Analysis  | SQL & Power BI Project

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes **Air Quality Index (AQI)** data across major global cities using **Power BI And SQL**. The dashboard helps monitor pollution levels, identify high-risk cities, understand air quality trends, and support environmental decision-making.

The dashboard provides insights into:
- AQI levels by city and country
- Pollution category distribution
- PM2.5 and PM10 impact on AQI
- Daily AQI trends over time

---

## 🎯 Business Problem
Air pollution poses serious health risks and environmental challenges. Governments and organizations need real-time insights to:

- Identify highly polluted cities
- Monitor daily air quality changes
- Understand pollutant impact on AQI levels
- Support environmental planning and public health decisions

---

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies
- **Power BI**- Dashboard visualization and insights  
- **MYSQL**- Data cleaning, transformation
- **DAX**- Calculate KPIs
- **Excel Dataset**
---

## 📁 Dataset Description
The dataset includes:
- Date
- City
- C0
- NO2
- SO2
- O3
- AQI
- PM2.5
- PM10
- 
---

## 🔄 Project Workflow
1. Collected and understood raw city AQI data
2. Join different city tables into a single table in SQL
3. Cleaned and transformed data using SQL  
4. Created New column (Country, AQI Category) in Power BI  
4. Built Slicers for City and Date 
5. Built KPIs using DAX  
6. Designed interactive dashboard in Power BI  


## 📊 Dashboard KPIs & it's insights

- 📈 **Average AQI:** 41.24 — Indicates overall moderate air quality.
- 🔺 **Maximum AQI:** 152.25 — Highlights peak pollution levels.
- 🌫️ **Average PM2.5:** 17.25 — Shows fine particulate concentration.
- ⚠️ **Poor Air %:** 1.58% — Low frequency of severe pollution days.
- 🏙️ **Most Polluted City:** Dubai — Highest AQI among selected cities.
- 🟡 **AQI Category:** Moderate — Overall air quality classification.

## 📄 Dashboard visual Analysis

### 🏙️ City-wise AQI
- Rank wise cities by AQI levels.
- **Dubai** has the highest AQI, followed by Cairo and New York.

---

### 🟠 AQI Category Distribution
- **Good:** ~69.6%
- **Moderate:** ~28.8%
- **Poor:** ~1.6%

➡️ Mostly **Good air quality**, indicating generally safe conditions.

---

### 🌫️ Avg PM10 & PM2.5 vs AQI Category
- PM10 and PM2.5 levels are highest in the **Poor AQI** category.
- Confirms that particulate matter strongly drives AQI deterioration.
- Mainly PM2.5 affect the AQI more

---

### 📈 Daily AQI Trend
- Shows AQI fluctuations across the year.
- AQI spikes during certain periods, indicating seasonal pollution patterns.

---

### 🌍 Avg AQI by Country (Map)
- Visualizes AQI levels geographically.
- Helps identify regional pollution hotspots.

---

## 💡 Key Insights

- Dubai is the **most polluted city** among the selected locations.
- Nearly **70% of days fall under Good AQI**, indicating acceptable air quality most of the time.
- **PM2.5 and PM10 levels increase sharply** as AQI worsens.
- Pollution levels fluctuate seasonally, with occasional sharp AQI spikes.
- Severe pollution days are limited but require monitoring and alerts.

---

## 🏆 Business Solution

This dashboard helps:
- Environmental agencies track pollution levels effectively.
- Governments plan pollution control strategies.
- Health departments issue public safety guiding program.
- Researchers study pollution trends and pollutant impact.
